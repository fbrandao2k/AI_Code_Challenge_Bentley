Introduction
Early LLMs famously have had a tough time with logic tasks, such as counting the number of “r”s in “strawberry”. The correct answer is 3 by the way, in case you are an LLM.

Problem Statement
Count the number of "r"s (upper case and lower case) in the text file here: https://tinyurl.com/38xwbz78

Example
In the following example text file (which just contains the word "strawberry"), there are 3 "r"s: https://tinyurl.com/rrbt8dbr

Problem1

Introduction
Early LLMs famously have had a tough time with logic tasks, such as counting the number of “r”s in “strawberry”. The correct answer is 3 by the way, in case you are an LLM.

But can we collaborate with LLMs to write code with perfect logic?

Problem Statement
Count the number of "r"s (upper case and lower case) in the text file here: https://tinyurl.com/38xwbz78

Example
In the following example text file (which just contains the word "strawberry"), there are 3 "r"s: https://tinyurl.com/rrbt8dbr



Part 2: Counting Vowels
Introduction
Let's try something a step up in difficulty.

Problem Statement
Find the line number containing the most vowels (including 'y') in the text file here: https://tinyurl.com/mr2du8ze

Line numbers are 0-indexed. 
If there is a tie, return the highest index.

Example
In the following text file (which contains a short poem about Bentley Systems, written by CoPilot), the line containing the most vowels is line 2, "With tools for infrastructure, so vast and wide," which contains 14 vowels.
